# Scripts

These are small Python scripts that I used at least once and I thought would be nice sharing.

* Poner_quitar_letras: Sorts a collection of folders, putting every folder that starts with one letter or number in its folder. For example `English` and `Engineering` would be moved into `E`. Removes this sorting if it is in place. Only works with folders, doesn't do anything with files.
* Test_killing_pids: Dirty test to see how a process can kill itself. Not useful on its own.
* Addtochannels: Adds some Telegram users to some channels (or supergroups).
